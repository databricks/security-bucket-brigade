# Cloud Tagging Policy

Asset tagging in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) is critical for security, compliance, and cost attribution efforts. Tagging allows quick identification of asset ownership and other critical properties. These properties are often critical when doing incident follow-up.

## Required Tags

The following tags are required to be added to ALL resources that support tagging.

Tag enforcement is managed via [Cloud Custodian](./Cloud-Tagging-Policy.md). Reasonable notice will be attempted prior to enabling new enforcement policies.

_Please note that tags are **case sensitive**, so for example a tag with the key “Owner” is different than “owner”._

| Tag Key (Case sensitive) | Tag Value                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Non-Compliant Action                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owner                    | An email address the individual who authoritatively owns the resource. This contact is able to speak authoritatively regarding the purpose / contents of the resource and can make decisions about access and deletion. | Automatic deletion of un-tagged resource _(note: automated effort is made to tag the “Owner” as whoever created the bucket, but this should not be relied upon)_ |

## Best Practices Tags

The following tags should be used as a best practice on all cloud assets that support tagging. Asset owners should consider these tags to minimize future changes to their assets.

| Tag Key (Case sensitive) | Tag Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Name                     | A descriptive name for an asset. In many places in AWS the name field is displayed to provide quick human-readable information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Service                  | A descriptive name for an asset grouping. This should be a name to logically group related assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example: For an application that is comprised of an ALB, Target Group, EC2 instances, a security group, and a DNS CNAME; having a tag that is common to all of these resources allows them to be easily associated as part of the same logical application.                 |
| Description              | A human-consumable description of the purpose of the tagged asset. This should enable someone to get a very basic idea of why an asset exists, without having to consult with the owner.                                                                                                                                                                   | The description field should be high-level and avoid being too lengthy.<br><br>All clouds have a maximum character length for tags - e.g. for most resources in AWS, there is a 255 character limit (as of 2020-02-25). The description should be well within these limits. |
| Creator                  | An email address of an individual or group mailbox that was responsible for the resource creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | As resource owners and creators are not always that same, this is useful to record especially when ownership is transferring from one person or team to another.                                                                                                            |

| PII                      | Boolean (`true` or `false`)<br><br>PII is Personally Identifiable Information.

| NotAfter                 | A date value (formatted `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g. “`2021-01-01`”), after which a resource can be automatically removed. This is especially useful for short-lived resources or projects.<br><br>Assets with this tag should not be used by any long-lived assets or processes.                                                                                    | Only apply this tag to resources that you own and are certain can be removed after the provided date. This tag is an indicator to automated clean-up processes that the asset can be deleted after that time, potentially without other confirmation.                       |
